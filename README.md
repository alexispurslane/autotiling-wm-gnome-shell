# Auto Tiling
## A GNOME extension providing automatic tiling window management in the style of the Pop Shell tiling extension

With Pop OS planning a move to the COSMIC DE, leaving their GNOME extensions behind unmaintained, and their extension already incompatible with GNOME 44, what will happen to those of us who wish to remain on GNOME while maintaining that automatic tiling goodness? That's what this project aims to answer. We want to create a simple, stable, no-frills replacement for the Pop Shell extension that is future-proofed for all future GNOME versions (including no longer being written in TypeScript and then compiled to GJS with a combination of `tsc` and a hack-job of a shell script running regexes) and available on the https://extensions.gnome.org.

NOTE: this project is very early in development, little more than an overgrown experiment, right now!
